We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-mysql/releases).


Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:

###  MySQL
```hcl
  module "mysql" {
  source                      = "clouddrove/mysql/aws"

    database_name = "test"
    username = "user"
    password = "esfsgcGdfawAhdxtfjm!"
    port     = "3306"

    vpc_security_group_ids = [module.security_group.security_group_ids]

    maintenance_window = "Mon:00:00-Mon:03:00"
    backup_window      = "03:00-06:00"

    multi_az = true

    # disable backups to create DB faster
    backup_retention_period = 0

    enabled_cloudwatch_logs_exports = ["audit", "general"]

    # DB subnet group
    subnet_ids = module.subnets.public_subnet_id
    publicly_accessible = true

    # DB parameter group
    family = "mysql5.7"

    # DB option group
    major_engine_version = "5.7"

    # Snapshot name upon DB deletion

            value = "37"
          },
        ]

## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
